## Issues

1. Error Message `rejected promise not handled within 1 second: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory...`
When trying to create new files or save files in debugging workspace,
```shell
rejected promise not handled within 1 second: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, watch '/Users/josephzhou/Documents/Projects/testDir/HEAD'
/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/workbench/api/node/extensionHostProcess.js:102
stack trace: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, watch '/Users/josephzhou/Documents/Projects/testDir/HEAD'

	at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
```
This warning is because the debugging workspace/directory is not git-initialized. Simply run `git init` got rid of the warning
